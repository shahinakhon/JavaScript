Variables

let  - sets variables that will change
const - sets variables with constant value

const name = value;
let name = value;

string value should be in ""

than we console.log(name) to print out the output

to change value of variable that was set with let :

let variableName = "First value";
variableName = "Second value";

Data Types:

#Number 
 let var = 343

 ##String
 let var = "in quaotas single or double"

 ###Boolean (True or False)
 let var = True

 ####Null and Undefined
 data types that represent there's an absence of a value, and are written with null and undefined respectively (without double or single quotes):

    * null represents the intentional absence of value.
    * undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.

let var = null 
let varSecond = undefined 

// Write code below ðŸ’–
let number = 5
let string = "Hello"
let myBoolean = false

console.log(number)
console.log(string)
console.log(myBoolean)

JavaScript has the following arithmetic operators:

    + Addition
    - Subtraction
    * Multiplication
    / Division
    % Modulo (returns the remainder)


// Write code below ðŸ’–
const temp = 82
